# Slimier Slimes
Current Version supports 1.16.4

# Overview
Slimier Slimes is a slimy mod, filled with lots of gooey goodness that will allow you to jiggle with these cutesy little friends.

# Content
Slimier Slimes adds a variety of things that will enrich vanilla MC gameplay with more slimestuff.

## Entities
There is a wide variety of slimes added by this mod.

The original slime has been completely rewritten to be properly supported. If any mod based itself on the OG slime, they will break. Let the developers know, so we can determine if change is needed.

A variety of new slimes have been added:
- Creeper Slime
- Camo Slime
- Crystal Slime
- Glow Slime
- Rock Slime
- Lava Slime
- Pinky Slime
- Snow Slime
- Lava Slime
...
  
We have also added a new Illager related to slimes. He'll summon slimes to fight you or throw slimeballs at you to slow you down. Find him in the Illager Slime Labs.

## Slime Spawning
Slimechunks have been fully removed. Instead a new structure will spawn underground that spawns all kinds of slimes.

The swamp has also been more slimified. You'll find all slimes spawning there, regardless of their normal spawning rules.

Lastly, the smallest slimes will become a more dangerous force as well, they might spawn in big!

## New Items
Slimes no longer drop slimeballs, but instead drop slime jelly. This jelly can be pressed into our well know slimeballs, but in all different colours!

## Blocks
Slime is now everywhere.

Underground, blocks will spawn that relate to jelly. Not only in the slimier structures, but just in general.

The old slime block has received friends in all colours, but every colour has its own impact. Parkour builders will be able to use these to create new challenges on their tracks. The other builders will have some new slimy colours at their disposal to make interesting constructions.
